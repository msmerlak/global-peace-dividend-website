The Global Peace Dividend Initiative was started in 2021 by physicist Carlo Rovelli with help from Matteo Smerlak, Alevtina Nepomniachtchikh, and others. 

The Initiative draws inspiration from the [Pugwash Conference](https://pugwash.org/), a society of scientists which played a role in convincing the Soviet and US governments to collaborate at the height of the cold war, by agreeing to destroy some 80â€“90% of their nuclear warheads. 

Its aim is to catalyze an international agreement to jointly reduce military spending and redirect the huge savings to a global fund to fight planetary emergencies.
