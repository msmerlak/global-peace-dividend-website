# The proposal

World military spending has doubled since 2000, is approaching 2 trillions US dollars per year, and is increasing in all world's regions (*). 

Individual governments are under pressure to increase military spending because others do so as well. The feedback mechanism sustains a spiralling arms race—a colossal waste of resources that could be used far more wisely. Past arms races have often had the same outcome: deadly and destructive conflicts.

We have a simple proposal for humankind: the governments of all UN member-states negotiate a joint reduction of their military expenditure by 2% every year. 

This rational of the proposal is simple: 

Adversary nations reduce military spending, so the security of each country is increased. Deterrence and balance are preserved.
The agreement contributes to reducing international animosity, decreasing the risk of war.   
Vast resources —a 'peace dividend' of up to 1 trillion USD by 2030— become available.

We propose that half of the resources liberated by this agreement remain at the use of governments—all countries can have fresh resources. Some of these should be used to redirect the strong research capacities of military industries towards urgently needed peaceful applications. The other half be allocated to a global fund, under UN supervision, to address humanity's grave common problems: pandemics, climate change, and extreme poverty. 

International agreements to limit the proliferation of dangerous weapons are possible: thanks to the SALT and START treaties, the United States and the Soviet Union have reduced their nuclear arsenals by 90% since the 1980's. Such negotiations can succeed because are rational: each actor benefits from its adversaries' armament reduction, and so does humanity as a whole. 

Humankind faces risks that can be averted only through cooperation. 

Let us cooperate, instead of fighting among ourselves.
